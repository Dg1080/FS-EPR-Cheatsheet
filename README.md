#  Fast Stream EPR Cheatsheet

## Intro

I got fed up of having to cross reference multiple documents when I want to know what a behaviour should look like, so I made this. 

Each behaviour has its definition, strength relations (with definitions) and examples for levels three (HEO/SEO) and four (Grade 7 / 6), 

## Behaviours:

* [Changing and improving](behav/change_improve.md)
* [Communicating and influencing](behav/comm_influencing.md)
* [Delivering at Pace](behav/deliver_at_pace.md)
* [Developing self and others](behav/devel_self_others.md)
* [Leadership](behav/leadership.md)
* [Making Effective Decisions](behav/making_effec_decisions.md)
* [Managing a Quality Service](behav/manage_qual_service.md)
* [Seeing the big picture](behav/see_big_picture.md)
* [Working together](behav/work_together.md)
