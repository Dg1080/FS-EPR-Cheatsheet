Delivering At Pace – Level 4 Grade 7

Below is a draft written example for a more senior role.

I led a team of 4 to organise a 2-day conference (name it) for 150 people with 6 weeks’ notice instead of the minimum 4 months, to accommodate the availability of an international speaker. I delivered the conference by:

    Effectively prioritising my workload to manage competing priorities. I delegated non-managerial tasks for other projects to junior colleagues (for example), ensuring I had sufficient time to oversee planning and delivery.
    Appointing and motivating a project team. I communicated priorities and objectives (for example) with enthusiasm, allocating roles and responsibilities that aligned with team members’ strengths and interests (for example). To promote teamwork, I encouraged the development of a shared vision for the conference (for example).
    Regularly reviewing the quality and consistency of my team’s performance. Using project management tools (for example) I monitored key deliverables in relation to an agreed timetable and factored in contingency plans. I introduced a new platform (for example) improving communication and collaborative working between the team based in different locations.
    Supporting my team to overcome challenges. When senior leaders requested an additional conference theme at short notice, I encouraged the team to assess different options before collectively agreeing on the solution (for example). I instilled confidence in their ability to deliver quality outcomes by praising their achievements and supporting their professional development.

Due to my leadership and project management skills, the conference was delivered on time and within budget, achieving a high (add details) delegate satisfaction rate.
